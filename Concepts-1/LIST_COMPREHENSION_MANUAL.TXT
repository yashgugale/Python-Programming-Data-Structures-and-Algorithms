SYNTAX I : [<v> for <v> in <it>]

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYNTAX II : [f(<v>) for <v> in <it>]

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYNTAX III : [<v> for <v> in <it> if COND(<v>)]
Step 1 : Split <it> into it's constituent elements
Step 2 : Subject each constituent element to COND
Step 3 : Select only those elements which yield result TRUE.
Step 4 : Form list out of it

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYNTAX IV : [f(<v>) for <v> in <it> if COND(<v>)]
Step 1 : Split <it> into it's constituent elements
Step 2 : Subject each constituent element to COND
Step 3 : Select only those elements which yield result TRUE.
Step 4 : Apply f on all elements which passed filter test in Step 3.

Step1 : Split it1, it2, ... itn into their constituent elements
Step2 : Apply filter, if any, to iterable and select only those elements from iterables
which satisfy filter condition.
Step3 : Take cartesian product of sets formed out of filtered iterables as filtered in step2

Step1 : Split it1, it2, ... itn into their constituent elements
Step2 : Apply filter, if any, to iterable and select only those elements from iterables
which satisfy filter condition.
Step3 : Apply f1 on filtered elements in it1, f2 on filtered elements in it2 and so forth.
Step4 : Take cartesian product of results obtainted in Step3
Step5 : Resultant list is a collection of all tuples formed out of cartesian product.

SYNTAX VIII : [g(f1(x1), f2(x2), ..., fn(xn)) for x1 in it1 if COND1(x1)
                                             for x2 in it2 if COND2(x2)

                                             Step1 : Split it1, it2, ... itn into their constituent elements
Step2 : Apply filter, if any, to iterable and select only those elements from iterables
which satisfy filter condition.
Step3 : Apply f1 on filtered elements in it1, f2 on filtered elements in it2 and so forth.
Step4 : Take cartesian product of results obtainted in Step3
Step5 : Apply function g on each tuple formed in Step4. REMEMBER THAT EVERY TUPLE OBTAINED
in STEP 4 will have one dimension related to one function. Element at index 0 is
corrossponding to f1, element at index 1 is corrosponding to f2 and so forth and g is
expressed in terms of f1(x1), f2(x2) ... to fn(xn). Apply the formula to each component
of a tuple. Form a result. Discard tuple. Resultant list is a list of result when g
is applied on each tiple formed in step 4.
